Late Binding: VBScript allows late binding, meaning you can call methods or access properties of an object without explicitly declaring the object type. This can lead to runtime errors if the object doesn't have the expected member or if the member's type is unexpected.  Example:  `Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object")`  `obj.NonExistentMethod`  This would throw an error at runtime if `Some.Object` doesn't have a method named `NonExistentMethod`.
